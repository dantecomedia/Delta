Personalize Time Scheduler
This scheduler works on prinicpal of alternative study and rest. 
For example, if a person wants to study for 15mins and 10mins rest and then again the 15min study and rest in a cyclic pattern, 
then it will help scheduling the task and alerting at the same time
this is basically inspired from this ted talk :
